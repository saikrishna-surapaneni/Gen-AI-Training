📘 Catalogue Intelligence System with RAG

An end-to-end Catalogue Management System (CMS) + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that turns raw product catalogs into an intelligent, searchable knowledge system.

This system helps estimators, designers, and engineers quickly find accurate, grounded product information from PDFs, specs, and price lists — without hallucinations.

🚀 What This Project Does

It converts messy catalog data into a structured AI-searchable system:

PDFs / CSVs / Images
        ↓
CMS (Validated Structured Data)
        ↓
Text → Embeddings
        ↓
MongoDB Vector Search
        ↓
RAG (Retrieve + Generate)
        ↓
Grounded Answers with Page References

🧠 System Architecture
1️⃣ Data Sources

📄 PDF product catalogs (scanned + digital)

🖼 Product images

📊 Specifications (CSV)

💰 Price lists (CSV)

2️⃣ CMS Layer (Catalogue Management System)

Responsible for data validation and structuring before AI usage.

Input	Processing	Output
PDF catalogs	Hybrid text extraction (Native + OCR)	Page-structured product descriptions
CSV price lists	Structured ingestion	SKU → Price
Specs CSV	Structured ingestion	SKU → Technical specs
Images	Extracted & renamed	Linked by SKU or page

✔ Page numbers are preserved
✔ Images intelligently matched
✔ Human validation logic ensures SKU accuracy

3️⃣ Text Extraction (Improved)

The system uses a Hybrid Extraction Strategy:

Page Type	Method
Digital text PDF	Native extraction (PyMuPDF)
Scanned/image PDF	EasyOCR deep learning OCR

This avoids OCR errors when text is already embedded and improves accuracy for scanned catalogs.

4️⃣ Embedding Layer

Validated product text is:

Split into semantic chunks

Assigned correct page numbers

Given unique chunk IDs (no overwriting)

Converted into embeddings using MiniLM

Stored in MongoDB Atlas Vector Search

5️⃣ Retrieval (RAG)

When a user asks a question:

Query → embedding

MongoDB vector search retrieves relevant chunks

Correct catalog page numbers are preserved

Context sent to LLM

LLM generates grounded answer with sources

6️⃣ Answer Generation

The LLM:

Uses only retrieved catalog data

Avoids hallucinations

Provides traceable product info

Supports fuzzy model number matching

Handles imperfect OCR model numbers

🧰 Tech Stack
💾 Data Storage
